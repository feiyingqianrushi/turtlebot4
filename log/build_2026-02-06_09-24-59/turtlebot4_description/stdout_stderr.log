CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findirobot_create_description.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "irobot_create_description", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "irobot_create_description" with any of the following names:

    irobot_create_descriptionConfig.cmake
    irobot_create_description-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "irobot_create_description" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "irobot_create_description_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "irobot_create_description" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
